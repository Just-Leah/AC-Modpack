description = "This is Corresponding mod to the world map portion of Journey Map on the Approved Mods list, as there is no Fabric version.\nThis mod adds a world map which can be opened by pressing `m`, and shows a scrollable map of the world you are in (the only limit is your exploration). This also includes waypoints set using Xaero's Minimap.\n\nREQUIRES:\n- Fabric API\n\nCan be used with:\n- Xaero's Minimap: Full and Fair-play (The two maps use the same cache and waypoint system, and work together well. You can do one or the other, but I recommend both)"
